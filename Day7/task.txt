Initial Task: Install boto3 (pip install boto3) and configure AWS credentials (aws configure).
(pip install boto3 & aws configure)

Challenge 1: Write a Python script that provisions an EC2 instance, a new security group, and a key pair.
The same script should connect to ec2 after creation to check that everything is working fine. 
(The key pair should be generated via the Python script and used for the EC2 SSH connection.)

Challenge 2: Automate S3 lifecycle policies using boto3 (e.g., move files to Glacier after 30 days).

Challenge 3: Create a script that starts or stops all EC2 instances in a specific AWS region.

Challenge 4: Write a Python program that checks for unused IAM users and disables them.

Challenge 5: Implement a log monitoring system that scans EC2 instances' /var/log for error messages
 and sends alerts via email (AWS SES) and Slack.

Challenge 6: Automate DNS record updates in AWS Route 53 using Python.

Challenge 7: Write a script that triggers an AWS Lambda function using boto3.

Challenge 8: Use boto3 to fetch AWS billing data, and generate a cost analysis report in PDF format
